# Collatz Sequence

This Python script calculates the next number in the Collatz sequence for a given integer. The Collatz sequence is defined as follows:
- If the number is even, divide it by 2.
- If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

## Description

The script prompts the user to enter an integer and then calculates and prints the next number in the Collatz sequence using the provided integer.

## Usage
